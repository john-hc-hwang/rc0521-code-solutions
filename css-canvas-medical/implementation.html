          <h3><span class="number">1.</span> Making the Decision To Switch</h3>
          <p class="imp-paragraph-2">
            You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that <br>
            we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our <br>
            goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one <br>
            way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for <br>
            you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk <br>
            about their experience.
          </p>
          <h3><span class="number">2.</span> Interfaces and Community Integration</h3>
          <p class="imp-paragraph-2">
            Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community <br>
            resources. At a minumum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your <br>
            payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll <br>
            also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that <br>
            sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, If interfaces with health <br>
            information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we <br>
            will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.
          </p>
          <h3><span class="number">3.</span> Data Migration</h3>
          <p class="imp-paragraph-2">
            The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which <br>
            we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR <br>
            databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and <br>
            information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward. <br>
            While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has <br>
            been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
          </p>
          <h3><span class="number">4.</span> Training and Site Visit</h3>
          <p class="imp-paragraph-2">
            We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content, <br>
            charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks <br>
            prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice <br>
            management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our <br>
            team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and <br>
            training.
          </p>
          <h3><span class="number">5.</span> Go-Live and Tuning</h3>
          <p class="imp-paragraph-2">
            Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be <br>
            with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure <br>
            everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a <br>
            handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: Changing clinical microtemplates, <br>
            setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more. <br>
            We are here to help with it all.
          </p>
          <h3><span class="number">6.</span> Sustained Performance</h3>
          <p class="margin-bot imp-paragraph-2">
            All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide <br>
            support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not <br>
            meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments <br>
            back. (We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a <br>
            MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it. And for <br>
            everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a <br>
            long, productive partnership for us both.
